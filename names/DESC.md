# REBASE names

Some REBASE data are not directly available from FTP, but can be obtained from
component names. For example, Dnd/Dpt systems, which use DNA phosphorothioate
modifications, can be distinguished only by 'Dnd' or 'Dpt' parts of the
component names. This folder contains data obtained from such component
name interpretation, which is not fully reliable.

Protein names are used to fix protein and system types annotation, to assign
protein categories, and to join components into systems.
